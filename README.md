# Child-Language-Analyser
This is a 3 part python program that works on the ENNI Dataset of narrative transcripts gathered for clinical study carried out in Alberta, Canada, to study children with language disorders. Here SLI denoted children with Specific Language Impairment and TD represents Typical Development. 
A subset of the original dataset has been used this project.
Module 1 performs filtering on the dataset to extract the required chat features and eliminating the rest.
Module 2 performs analysis on the filtered results, using the chat symbols.
Module 3 visualizes the output of the analysis to present them in a graphical manner.
